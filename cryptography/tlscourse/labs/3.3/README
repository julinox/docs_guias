Create a CA and sign 2 different certs for 2 different servers

Steps:
- Generate keys (RSA)
- Generate CA self-signed CERT
- Generate keys/certs for 'server1' and 'server2'
- Generate CSR for both servers (openssl req -new)
- Sign (openssl ca -config someconfig -cert ca-cert -key ca-key -in the-csr -out some.cert)

Notes:
RootCA/CA/serial.txt points to current serial (to set for new signing)
RootCA/CA/serial.txt.old points to previous serial number
